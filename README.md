# API buscape Web scraping

This API provides a web scraping solution to obtain product data from the Buscap√© website. With the API, it is possible to extract information such as product name, price, description, and image by searching for a specific term.

This API serves the frontend available at this address: [Repo-frontend](https://github.com/Megas-MDN/product-search)

## Application flow

The API accepts a GET request at the route '/', and the response is a JSON object containing the key "source" with a value of "web" or "database". The other key is "results", which has an array with the results of all products summed from three categories (celular, tv e geladeira) of two stores (Buscap√© and Mercado Livre).

Another possible route is '/search?' that accepts three query parameters: q = search for a term, cat = search in a category (celular, tv e geladeira), and web = filter the results between Buscap√© or Mercado Livre store.

For example, a valid one is: /search?q=iphone&cat=celular&web=buscape. In this case, the API checks if this search has been previously performed. If so, it returns the result from the database within the 'results' key and the 'source': 'database' key.

Otherwise, the API checks if the access key sent in the request header matches the internal key. Only if the keys match, the API stores the search results in the database.

The application has integration and unit tests of the main functionalities.
